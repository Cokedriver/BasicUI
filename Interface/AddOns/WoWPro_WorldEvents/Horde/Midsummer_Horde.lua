N About this Guide|N|QID|11971|The original guide was written by Xicon, who gave permission for it to be coded into Tour Guide form, and was coded and modified by Jiyambi. This guide assumes you are at or near the level cap, have all the relevant flight paths, and have your hearth set to Orgrimmar. Often using your own flying mount will be more efficient, but the flighpaths are left in so you can fly afk if needed. Just check them off if you want to fly on your own. Keep in mind that about half of this holiday requires you to perform actions which flag you as PvP, so even on a PvE realm you will probably see some PvP action. You may want to leave your gear in the bank, in case you need to rez at the spirit healer.|

N Before you start... |N|QID|11971|Make sure you have your hearth set to Orgrimmar, as we will be using it to quickly get from place to place. For the Kalimdor steps the fightpaths were left in, but the rest of the guide counts on you using your own mount (or finding your own flightpaths).|

N PLAN OF ATTACK - IRONFORGE|QID|9331|N|Here's the plan - you're headed for the Hall of Explorers, which is directly across the city from where you enter. The first area when you enter also contains the auction house and bank, and is usually crawling with people. Unless you have stealth, this will probably be a corpse hopping situation, so you may want to remove your gear. In addition, if this holiday is like the others this year, people will probably be on the lookout and ready to snipe those trying to complete these achievements. You can either try to sneak around the edges of the city, or just run straight through the forge at the center.|
