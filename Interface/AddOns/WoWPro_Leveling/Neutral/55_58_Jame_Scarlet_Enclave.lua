-- Log: Added notes, fixed a couple of cords, added in the turn-ins for the quests "Where Kings Walk" and "Warchief's Blessing." Changed Map ID to "ScarletEnclave (Death Knight)" as "ScarletEnclave - Death Knight" was giving me a map can not be found error. Added a few steps to get Death Knights to Blasted Lands.
