-- Log: Added minimum level guide; At Level 44, you don't have the Flightpoint to Thousand Needles, so added info on getting there; You have the flightplan to Gadgetzan when you are in Speedbarge regardless of not previously using the route, so added this as your method of travel to avoid swimming/running.
