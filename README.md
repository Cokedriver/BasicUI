# BasicUI

## About Basic UI
Basic UI is a custom Userinterface for the Game World of Warcraft.

I was torn between a few UI's to use a while back and then relized I could take pits a pices from each UI to make it my own.
So that is what i did, this is a combination of NeavUI and TukUI the way i wanted them to be. 
All addons that are in this UI I was given permission to use.

####Here are a few things that are include in BasicUI:
- Ace Structure for In-Game GUI.
- Stand Alone UI (there are integration of other addons to work with BasicUI).
- Custom Unitframe Scaleing.
- AutoSell all Grey items at a vendor.
- Datatext bar below actionbars or can be moved to top of screen.
- Selfbuff Reminder
- Detail Tooltip
- User Friendly Chat

And much, much, more take a chance download BasicUi and give it a try.



Thank You and Enjoy
